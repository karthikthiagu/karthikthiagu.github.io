excerpt: A poem that tries to capture a mother's love for her little child at the end of a hectic day.

I sneak into the mansion,  
With a pilferer’s precision,  
To snatch a glance,  
At my little queen in trance

<br><br>

The adventures of the morn,  
Have left me torn,  
Betwixt a yearning for repose,  
And another sight at my rose.

<br><br>

Mother’s love shall prevail,  
My sinews’ cries to no avail,  
As wearied feet,  
Ferry me to my eye’s treat.
