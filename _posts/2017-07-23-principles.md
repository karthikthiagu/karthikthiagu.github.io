**Silence**<br><br>

It is only in the silence of the mind that God reveals himself.

The cup must be emptied of negative thoughts before God can pour his wisdom into the mind of the mortal.

**Time**<br><br>

The spirit animating all things can be discovered if time can be stilled. Deliberately slowing things down to enter into a flow can help to some extent.

**Balance**<br><br>

Balance is to perfectly perform multiple activities.

The pendulum must keep swinging between either ends; inertia or a dumb satisfaction with the motionless state is alien to a pendulum in God's friction-less universe. But earthlings should be aware of their limitations. A blind and mechanical motion will break the machine. Man must relax and contemplate if he doesn't want to miss the forest for the trees.

**Integral knowledge**<br><br>

“A thought is an arrow shot at the truth; it can hit a point, but not cover the whole target. But the archer is too well satisfied with his success to ask anything farther.” - Sri Aurobindo

**Opinions**<br><br>

"An opinion is neither true nor false, but only serviceable for life or unserviceable; for it is a creation of Time and with time it loses its effect and value. Rise thou above opinion and seek wisdom everlasting." - Sri Aurobindo

**Discipline**<br><br>

The will can be trained. It must be trained, both the positive and negative side.

**Concentration**<br><br>

**Emergence**<br><br>

The tree is present in the seed. With sufficient preparation and time what needs to emerge will break through the surface and shine forth.
