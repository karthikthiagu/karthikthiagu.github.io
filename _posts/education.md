# Education

This is a dialogue between a student and a teacher. The student has turned 25 today and has come to meet his middle-school teacher after several years.

**Student** : After 25 years of formal education, I don't know anything about myself or the world. What is the use of the education that I have received?

I desperately need to gain knowledge, but the very thought of the endeavor seems so overwhelming that I don't know where to start!

**Teacher** : When it comes to the acquisition of knowledge, the breadth is as important as the depth. A superficial knowledge of things will not take us very far in life; a narrow and one sided specialization is equally dangerous.

**Student** : But how can depth and breadth be achieved at the same time, for these are two orthogonal movements? 

**Teacher** : The conventional solution has been to sacrifice depth at the cost of breadth. This is a disease born of the materialistic age we live in, where quantity scores over quality. Syllabuses are constantly swelling to accommodate the growing knowledge of our age. A graduate student in physics needs to know all that Galileo, Newton, Einstein and Feynman discovered in their lifetimes, and discover something more. In the name of productivity and efficiency, students are forced to graduate as soon as they can. But we are beginning to see that "less is more". The other extreme is to get lost in the details by diving deep into one specialization and drowning in that. This tendency is also harmful to our progress. Unity in multiplicity is the law of the universe, and the same truth applies to studies of any kind.

**Student** : What happened during these 25 years? Why do I feel lost?

**Teacher** : The current system of education is not designed to help the individual grow in knowledge. It merely replaces old knowledge with new knowledge. What is required is a continual expansion of the learner's knowledge base. There is no mechanism to achieve this in our system. Expansion calls for assimilation of new information without dissolving the existing structure. This process requires a reorganization of the current knowledge base to accommodate information that comes in.

**Student** : What is the alternative then?

**Teacher** : A natural solution presents itself. Progress and perfection are are the twin principles that we will appeal to.

**Student** : **Why these two principles?**

**Teacher**

**Student** : 

**Teacher** : Progress acts as the motive power that constantly seeks to bring in fresh knowledge and drives the expansion. Perfection is the principle of stability that seeks to assimilate new information and organize knowledge without loosing what has already been formed.

**Student** : Why do you think this works?

**Teacher** : The first observation is that perfection and progress must proceed in tandem. Without a perfect harmony between these two principles, true learning cannot happen. The second observation is "to work from the near to the far, from that which is to that which shall be". At every step in the learning process, we must proceed from what we know to that which we want to know. A top down approach to learning is an absolutely nonsensical idea. As Sri Aurobindo says, the current system of education "attempts to heighten this practice of teaching by snippets at the bottom and the middle and suddenly change it to a grandiose specialism at the top. This is to base the triangle on its apex and hope that it will stand." This immediately suggests a bottom-up approach where the human mind is fueled by progress and stabilized by perfection. 

**Student** : Can you give me a well defined process?

**Teacher** : The principles have been well laid out, but to realize them in practice, a process must be devised that it is faithful to them at every turn. Begin with two subjects, and keep moving back and forth between them. The material must represent all the core elements of the subject without watering the details. A thorough mastery of this core will be the only preoccupation. Even here progress and perfection must alternate - first become familiar with the content, then study all the concepts involved carefully so that you understand what the author wishes to convey. This represents progress. To perfect it, form a mental representation of the content so that it becomes a part of you - this is what is meant by assimilation. Now weave this representation knowledge web that you have already constructed. Once the core elements are mastered in this way, move on to the next subject. But what about the subjects and content learned at the very beginning? Will they not be replaced by new knowledge? This is a valid concern. One way of addressing it is to revisit the subjects at increasing intervals of time. The exact mechanism is not very clear though. But another method is also quite possible. Rather than trying to do each subject very exhaustively at one sitting, and then keep revisiting the same content, one can begin with a small kernel of each subject and progressively expand  the subject can be divided into a certain number of sections, say four - a small core, followed by three sections that build on top of this core. But this requires a skillful framing of the syllabus.

**Student** : Most motorcyclists don't know anything about what is inside the vehicle. The bottom-up approach to learning dictates that one must master the anatomy of the motorcycle before learning how to drive.

**Teacher** : The motorcycle is a machine that facilitates transportation. And the dharma of motorcycle driving is twofold. Firstly a safe journey from the source to the destination that doesn't harm or even inconvenience fellow drivers and pedestrians. Secondly, a skillful maneuvering of the vehicle that expresses the beauty of the body and its movements. A perfect balance, right posture, quick reflexes, correct judgment, and patience are indispensable qualities for a driver. This is the motorcyclist's dharma. The knowledge of the interior of a motorcycle is useful information to a driver, but is of a very secondary importance. However, this knowledge forms the core of a mechanic's dharma. The various parts that make up a motorcycle, their functions and the functional dependence between the parts is the starting point. To this is added the knowledge of the various problems that a motorcycle develops during the course of its life, the causes of these problems, and their solution.  The mechanic is a experimental scientist whose laboratory is the motorcycle. Whether the mechanic can drive or not is absolutely irrelevant to his profession for his dharma doesn't demand that skill.


**Teacher** : We are living in the information age. One no longer needs to actively seek knowledge. He carries Plato's Republic, Einstein's Relativity and Vyasa's Mahabaratha in his pocket. One swipe on his smartphone screen will bring any of these things to life in the form of beautifully animated videos. The principle of progress is likely to dominate in this age. Man's desire to know more and more about the world around him, about his friends, his politicians and his movie stars is a clear expression of this urge. It may even be said that the discovery of the Internet is merely a crystallization of this tendency for swiftly gaining access to every sort of knowledge. Facebook's ostensible purpose is to connect people, but its true usage is to expose the private life of individuals for public display. In his enlightened hours man seeks to know himself, but the sensational and vital instinct in him finds pleasure in the external world of people and happenings. But the importance of the internet is undeniable and the wise man will strive to put it to such uses as will serve himself and mankind.

**Teacher** : To reestablish the harmony that has been disturbed by an excessive insistence on progress, we need to return to the stabilizing and organizing principle of perfection. It is not enough to appreciate, we must also understand. But even this is wont to evaporate unless we organize and perfect what has been learned.

**Teacher** : Spaced repetition is an important component of perfection. The student must read in chunks and revisit these chunks in ever increasing intervals until the chunk has sunk into his system. He must participate in this repetition until the time he has perfect recall of the chunk.
