title:   Dust Colony
category: Poems
excerpt: This poem breathes life into dust particles that colonize cars of lazy owners who never bother to clean it.
---



Dusting a car is an advertisement  
For dust-folk to frequent the car.  
Appealing ads draw dust-falls in dozens  
And drown the car in dust.    

<br><br>    

Master's absence sets the stage  
For dust-folk to colonize the car.  
But this conquest has not escaped  
The sharp eyes of little master.    

<br><br>
  
Gloved and ready for the massacre,  
Little master nears the car colony,  
Parks his face inches from it,  
Announcing his arrival  
With a demonic breath.    
  
<br><br>

Dust-folk cower in fear.  
With no room to take cover,  
They braze for Armageddon  
As little master's arms get down.  
A menacing five-fingered weapon  
Closes in on itself into a firm fist.    
  
<br><br>

Unexpectedly, a finger pops out  
And starts tracing geometric patterns  
On the dusty canvas:  
Triangular mountains, sinusoidal waves,  
Circulars sun and rectangular houses.    
  
<br><br>

Little master steps back  
To admire his painting on dust,  
And retreats to his abode.    
  
<br><br>
  
Dust-folk erupt in jubilation and frenzied worship:  
The hand of God had spared them,  
All was not done and dusted yet.
