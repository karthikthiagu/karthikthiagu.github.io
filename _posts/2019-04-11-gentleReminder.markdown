excerpt: A poem that talks about a day in the life of a "reminder e-mail" that is usally sent few minutes or hours before the start of meetings or seminars.

Summoned minutes before the deadline,  
To draw unwilling crowds to an empty hall,  
I send a thousand arms flying outward,  
In desperation to save my master’s face.  

  <br><br> 

Some arms are chopped mercilessly,  
By spam sentinels that guard the mailbox.

  <br><br>

Some are left dangling mid-channel,  
Struggling to squeeze through narrow bandwidths.

  <br><br>

Some land gently atop mountains of rotting mails,  
Declared dead on delivery.

  <br><br>

Some drop down on empty inboxes,  
And I turn to these for help.  
But is there any reward in being gentle,  
When fast fingers frivolously flip the arms aside?

  <br><br>

As the deadline nears, I begin to wonder,  
If my arms had been too gentle.

  <br><br>

And then a warm handshake breaks this cold spell,  
Then two, followed by three, and a few more.  
As successful arms scamper back with acknowledgments,  
The relief on my master’s face is palpable,  
My gentle arms have saved his face.
