excerpt: Looking at learning using the framework of graph theory.

- **Knowledge graph**: Consider a small, sparsely connected graph to start with. Nodes stand for concepts or ideas, edges stand for the relationships among them. You find yourself at one remote corner of this knowledge graph, largely ignorant of this mental landscape. *Learning is a graph completion problem: discover nodes and their relationships.*

- **Identify a destination**: This is the best way to explore a place. You could randomly visit places, but this haphazard movement will not take you anywhere. You will most likely return to the place you started from. *Moving in all directions is the same as not moving at all.*

- **Discover approxmate paths**: You know the destination and the source. Most of the time, you have a much better idea of the destination than the source. But you don't know the path that will take you from the source to the destination. This confusion could take two forms:

    - You don't know if there is even a path. This happens routinely in research and problem solving.
    - You know multiple paths, but you don't know which one to take.
    
    - In both cases, the first thing is to look at those who have come before you. Have they left a trail? This is where learning resources enter: books, videos, podcasts, research papers and so on. *Resources can just act as guides, it is ultimately upto you to travel the chosen path.*
 
- **Follow the nearest path**: Neighboring nodes are the best place to start. If they are difficult to find, you must develop the skill to abstract intermediate nodes or hops. This must be used with caution. That a motorcycle is "a metallic body with two wheels, brakes, handlebar, horn and indicators" is a good abstraction for its rider, but uninformative for a mechanic. *Avoid the abstraction trap: if everything is going to be abstracted, no learning can happen.*

- **Cement the path**: Retention is an often ignored aspect of learning. If you don't actively strive to retain what you learn, most of the knowledge acquired will evaporate. Retention can be achieved by trying these techniques:

    - Retrace the same path after a break. Keep retracing it at increasing intervals until the path gets burned in your memory. This is called spaced repetition.

    - Explain the idea to a group of people. This is the Feynman technique in action.

    - Keep examining the knowledge-graph and try to get the big picture. Map the idea to as many other nodes that you can find on the graph. This helps in strengthening the importance of the node.

    - Build a story around the node so that the idea is no longer a monolithic entity but a sequence of events.

    - Have a set of questions that act as attributes for each node. Every question word can potentially give rise to a question: why, what, where, when, how. Every edge can contribute to another question.

    - Minimal working examples help in providing a compact representation to an idea. Having the core concept in mind is more important than knowing the gory details.

- **Walk the path alone**: The best way of discovering a landscape is by walking. You can have a taxi take you from the source to the destination. But real knowledge only comes with struggling to find your way. *Real learning happens only when what you learn is non-trivial.*

- **Identify central nodes along the way**: These are nodes that have maximum connections with other nodes. This is the 80-20 concept in action. *20% of ideas are used 80% of the times*.

- **Identify multiple paths**: This offers different perspectives of looking at the same problem and broadens your understanding.

- **Random walk**: This exposes you to different areas of the knowledge-graph, especially those that you might not visit while you are traversing the current path. This can be very useful in unearthing links between disparate regions of the network. Such links have proven to be fertile springs for novel ideas in the past.

- **Malleable netwok structure**: In Knuth's words, "premature optimization is the root of all evil". The network structure must be let to evolve over time. Trying to fix the connections between nodes, and optimizing for recall should come well after being exposed to a concept for the first time.
