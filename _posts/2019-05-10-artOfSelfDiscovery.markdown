<h2 id="discovery"> Discovery </h2>

Let us begin with six strikingly similar quotes:

- Sri Aurobindo: Every one has in him something divine, something his own, a chance of perfection and strength in however small a sphere which God offers him to take or refuse. The task is to find it, develop it and use it.
- Sri Aurobindo : All action must be determined from within because each man has in him something his own, some characteristic principle and inborn power of his nature. That is the efficient power of his spirit, that creates the dynamic form of his soul in nature and to express and perfect it by action, to make it effective in capacity and conduct and life is his work, his true Karma: that points him to the right way of his inner and outer living and is the right starting-point for his farther development.
- The Mother : We should tell ourselves, “There must certainly be something I can do better than anyone else, since each one of us is a special mode of manifestation of the divine power which, in its essence, is one in all. However humble and modest it may be, this is precisely the thing to which I should devote myself, and in order to find it, I shall observe and analyse my tastes, tendencies and preferences, and I shall do it without pride or excessive humility, whatever others may think I shall do it just as I breathe, just as the flower smells sweet, quite simply, quite naturally, because I cannot do otherwise.”
- Emerson : There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.
- Hunter S. Thompson : To put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES. But don’t misunderstand me. I don’t mean that we can’t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors— but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires— including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.
- Sir Ken Robinson : Many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be, or if they have any to speak of. Human resources are like natural resources; they’re often buried deep. You have to go looking for them, they’re not just lying around on the surface.

It becomes clear from the above quotes that there is a discovery to be made. Let us call it self-discovery as it concerns the individual, the self. It is also clear that this act of self-discovery is inevitable for every thinking man, and to delay it further would do more harm than good and is equivalent to abrogating one's right to search for that unique element in him that he can offer to the world. This discovery may take two months or twenty years. But the most opportune moment to begin the search is now, not tomorrow, not the day after and not after one year. <br><br>

Words like self-discovery usually throw the practical side of the mind into a state of confusion. The pragmatic face of the human intellect primarily concerns itself with outer, visible actions that have tangible goals and rewards. It finds any sort of inner activity meaningless. Nothing can be further from the truth. Self-discovery is not about sitting in isolation, meditating, waiting for inspiration to strike, though it does contain a small component in that direction. It is about asking and answering questions of great importance concerning life and work:

- What is this unique element that I have within me?
- What skills best align with this element and give it the greatest scope for expression?
- Which professions require the use of these skills?
- How do such professions impact the society?

The difficulty of the questions or the absence of simple answers does not diminish the importance of this endeavour. The answers to the questions will shed light on one's nature that will in turn help one do meaningful work not just for oneself but also for the society and the world at large. But what great harm can come if one doesn't embark on this journey of self-discovery? Can't one still be useful to oneself and society by doing whatever one is currently doing? Why make a hue and cry over this nebulous concept of an individual's natural talents and capacities? Sri Aurobindo again has answers:

> To force the nature to abandon its own dharma is to do it permanent harm, mutilate its growth and deface its perfection. It is a selfish tyranny over a human soul and a wound to the nation, which loses the benefit of the best that a man could have given it and is forced to accept instead something imperfect and artificial, second rate, perfunctory and common.

The consequences of failing to discover one's own dharma is driven home more forcefully in the Gita. Quoting Sri Aurobindo's translation:

> Better the law of one‘s own being though it be badly done than an alien dharma well-followed; death in one’s own dharma is better, it is a dangerous thing to follow the law of another’s nature.

Philosophizing seems good on paper, but how does one go about making this discovery? There cannot be a common path for everyone, since each one is different and comes with a different set of talents and abilities. A fixed path for all to follow becomes a formula and not a discovery. So there must be something more general and abstract that we can turn to. For want of a better word, let us call it a process, though a process could also be rigid and formulaic as we will discover later. What is the process that we are looking for?

<h2 id="process"> Process </h2>

Before we arrive at a process that can act as a guide in self-discovery, let us ask if the average man follows some such process to guide him through life. A moment's thought will convince the reader that every man, consciously or unconsciously, is following some process. He has some representation of the past in his memory, a hold on the present, and a vision, however vague it may be, of the future. A process is a rope that runs through this temporal existence of man and gives him the support he needs to move forward. Not only is the existence of a process guaranteed, but there is a universal process that a great majority of mankind follows:

- education
- job
- marriage
- children
- property

We are more interested in the first two steps of the universal template : education and job. Specifically, let us examine a finer process that operates at this level. Though this sub-process ought to vary from person to person, the Indian mind has converged on a model that I dub the "Great Indian Process":


- primary and secondary education
- science specialization in high school
- engineering degree
- corporate job

This path has been trodden by millions of Indians, and anyone who has meticulously followed the Great Indian Process is declared successful. Every year tens of thousands of Indian students take the banal journey through this fairly straight path, making it safe and cozy for others to follow. There rarely seems to be any sign of regret for the "road not taken". <br><br>

For a moment let us assume that this is indeed the chief aspiration that should drive the children of our country and see how one usually goes about realizing this in practice. We start with the job and work backwards. Getting a job requires a good résumé. A good résumé should contain, among other things, a professional degree from an institution of repute. The institute demands that the individual develop proficiency in certain skills that are required for the award of the degree. Proficiency is usually measured by grades achieved by the candidate in examinations that are conducted by it. Now the funny part is that the individual needs to develop skills necessary to enter one of these institutes. There are coaching centers that train individuals to enter these institutes. Nowadays even coaching centers conduct examinations to filter candidates. The chosen ones, non-defective products so to speak, will be given rigorous training to enter the prestigious institutes of this nation. Thankfully, this doesn't devolve into an infinite regress owing to the finiteness of human life.<br><br>


After all this hoopla and several soul-crushing examinations later, it is common to find many a graduate unskilled, and therefore unemployed, with a degree that vouches for his proficiency in the very skills he lacks. And the few who seem to be doing well in some corporate job find that they lack crucial companion skills like good communication. What went wrong with the Great Indian Process?<br><br>

The very idea of working backwards, starting from the job and all the way back to a man's education, is flawed. We can reverse engineer machines not man. However well decorated it may be, a résumé is but a document. The problem is that we start with the document and then make the man. But the truth is the reverse, it is man who has to make the document. This is what Hunter S. Thompson means when he says that "we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal". Emptiness within is emptiness without. We must start with what man is at his core. His life’s mission is to discover his true nature, his purpose in this world. Taking Sri Aurobindo's words as a starting point, and working like a scientist, we begin with a statement that is at once an assumption and a definition:


> **Core** : Each individual has some characteristic principle and inborn power of his nature within him which determines for him the work that he is here to do in life.


From this assumption it follows that the skills that this individual must develop should be in harmony with his core. It immediately leads to the next step in the process. The job or profession becomes a field of activity that provides the widest and deepest possibilities for putting these skills to action. The process that we seek is this:

- core
- skills
- job

But discovering the core element is a life long process. To avoid being overwhelmed, every individual must start with a current estimate he has made of himself. A preliminary inquiry into his interests and strengths is the need of the hour. What things does he like to do? Maybe he likes cooking. What aspect of cooking does he like? It is quite possible that he may be greatly interested in dressing the dishes and neatly arranging them on a table. This means he is fond of organization and presentation, and this could form a part of his core. Cooking is a skill that lets him express these elements, but maybe there are other skills that offer a wider play for these faculties. <br><br>

As he is discovering his core, he must simultaneously work on a skill or a set of skills that best manifest the partially discovered core. As the Mother says, if he is sincere in his actions, he will steadily move closer to his core. As more and more of his core gets revealed, his skill sets need to enlarge to remain in harmony with his core. The activities that catered to his earlier state of being or temperament no longer satisfy him now and he needs to look for activities which will best express the enlarged and more refined skills he now possesses. This process is entirely organic. Core, skills and job co-evolve.<br><br>

The sense of disillusionment with work that strikes most men after a decade or so in their career, a form of work induced mid-life crisis, is essentially a conflict between two states of being. The first state of being is the one that a man has landed himself into by optimizing for a good, comfortable life by following the Great Indian Process down to a tee. He started with this objective and developed a set of skills that helped him achieve the objective. Expressing these skills places him in one state consciousness. The second state of being is his true self. Since he followed an artificial process, the two states of being have little overlap. This is the source of the conflict. Most stories of consultants turned artists, bankers turned teachers, are stories of individuals who belatedly discovered their cores and proceeded to reclaim them. What could be the reason for this delay in setting out on the path of discovery? The twin terrors of fear and failure stand in the way.


<h2 id="fearfailure">Fear and Failure</h2>

The impulse to settle down in life with a shelter over the head, a family by the side and a job to feed the stomach, is absolutely normal. But when this need becomes the dominating ideal in life, when the practical overpowers the spiritual, it is really an instance of fear masquerading as practicality. But the job market cannot guarantee security. In the name of a secure future we invest in every financial and economic device except man himself.<br><br>

The only failure is ignorance of the existence of a core. By that standard, I have been consistently failing all my life, even though I am a model of academic success to the world. Every individual who blindly follows the Great Indian Process is a failure. This is not to say that all engineers are failures. There are some - the true engineers - who know that this process is the one they would have chosen from among a thousand alternatives. <br><br>

Sri Aurobindo writes that: "Men labour only after success and if they are fortunate enough to fail, it is because the wisdom and force of Nature overbear their intellectual cleverness. God alone knows when and how to blunder wisely and fail effectively." In this sense, I am fortunate to have failed. What society regards as a splendid success is in reality an abject failure. We all know how easy it is to pass an exam and learn absolutely nothing enduring about the subject. Is that success or failure? Now that we have come this far, let us summarize the process that has been developed and frame it into a plan of action.

<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>

During times of exploration and discovery, plans can at best be broad outlines, compasses that give some orientation and direction to the days. Premature detailing may unduly constrain the search process. A plan at this stage must be deliberately amorphous. As the plan evolves, it gradually takes a definite form. There comes a stage when the plan ceases to be a document and becomes a way of living. Here is one such plan:<br><br>


While core is not complete:<br><br>


- Activity inventory : Prepare a list of activities that I have done in the past, starting from the most trivial ones like bathing and driving to non-trivial things like coding and research.
- Distill elements : Identify the key aspects, or elements, that are involved in each activity. As examples, take driving and cooking:
	- driving includes the following elements: a good balance, keen anticipation, sharp reflexes, capacity to visualize, an ability to estimate distances and time, patience and self restraint.
	-  cooking includes the following elements: a capacity for making precise measurements, a fine sense of proportions, well developed and highly sensitive senses of smell, taste and touch, an eye for the aesthetics of presentation, certain economy of hand movements, patience
- Identify elements of interest : Look for aspects that greatly interest me
- Prioritize repetitive elements : There are bound to be elements that are common across activities. I have observed that I like to maintain my balance on a motorcycle as best as I can before stopping at a signal. The sense of balance is also common in almost all sporting activities. 
- Form the core : Collect the elements together along with their priorities. This forms the current estimate of my core.
- Search for skills and corresponding activities : Look for skills that best express the core. 
- Eliminate impractical activities : There is a caveat here. Some activities will not make for a practical choice at this stage of life. For example, I can no longer become a professional athlete even though I am greatly interested in some of the elements associated with sports. So these activities need to be eliminated.
- Explore : Once a list of possible skills and associated activities has been formed, all activities have to be explored impartially. 
- Engage : Out of these a few will have to be chosen for serious engagement. And slowly these activities will start consuming more and more of my time.
- Pause, reflect and repeat

When will this discovery end? No one can tell. But I guess one would know when one makes the discovery. There is nothing sacrosanct about any stage in life, and therefore one relentlessly keeps moving forward, even if that means leaving behind certain gains from the past. The Mother expresses this beautifully:

> Until we know  *the*  essential thing we are intended to do, we must therefore find a temporary occupation which will be the best possible manifestation of our present capacities and our goodwill. Then we shall give ourselves to this occupation with conscientiousness and perseverance, knowing that it may well be only a stage and that with the progress of our ideal and our energies, we shall certainly one day be led to see more clearly the work we must accomplish.<br><br>

I will end this essay with the last stanza from a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:<br><br>

> Let us, then, be up and doing,  
With a heart for any fate;  
Still achieving, still pursuing,  
Learn to labor and to wait.
