# Will

**Student** : I know that certain actions are bad for my progress, yet I persist in doing them. And there are activities that aid my progress, but I don't take them seriously. Why am I like this?

**Teacher** : The problem is that your will is weak.

**Student** : But I am able to control my desire over food!

**Teacher** : That may be true. I don't deny that.

**Student** : So how can my willpower be the problem?

**Teacher** : When I offer you a cup of ice cream and you refuse, what can you infer?

**Student** : I have a strong will.

**Teacher** : Quite possible. But could it also mean that you don't like ice creams?

**Student** : But I like ice creams!

**Teacher** : When was the last time you had ice creams?

**Student** : It was quite a long time back. 

**Teacher** : Alright. Tell me one action that you feel is hindering your progress? 

**Student** : Watching the television.

**Teacher** : When was the last time you watched the television? 

**Student** : Today.

**Teacher** : You like watching the television and you like eating ice creams. You claim that you have a strong willpower. When you can use your will to not eat ice creams, what prevents you from using it to stop watching the television?

**Student** : Now I get it! I don't have a uniformly strong will.

**Teacher** : Exactly. The object on which the will is used matters a lot.  You may have a strong will when it comes to avoiding certain types of desires, but be powerless when it comes to others. And this differs from person to person.

**Student** : Great. Now that we have found the problem, how do I solve it?

**Teacher** : The most important truth concerning the will is that it becomes stronger with usage. Like the muscles in the human body, the will can be trained by a methodical and persistent effort.

**Student** : I don't think so. I have never been able to overcome some of my desires.

**Teacher** : It could mean one of two things. Either you have never felt bad about indulging in a wrong movement. Its recurrence has become something natural and has turned into a habit. An inveterate smoker falls under this category. Or you haven't used your will consistently to control the desire in question.

**Student** : I belong to the second category.

**Teacher** : I guessed so. The first step in overcoming a desire is the awareness that it is bad for your progress. 

**Student** : I know that it is bad, but I feel so weak when I am unable to control it.

**Teacher** : Your behavior is not in consonance with your ideal. A great self control is your ideal, but it seems to exist in thought alone, not in deed. The weakness that you perceive arises from this disconnect - you are a lion during the day, but a deer in the night. 

A gambler who is at ease with his gambling doesn't complain about his life. A stoic who has perfect self control is ever at peace with himself. But the desire-stricken soul who has realized his folly and seeks to overcome it, but is repeatedly thwarted in his efforts by a weak will is the great sufferer. It is obvious that his state is much better than the gambler's. But a prolonged presence in this middle region is enervating. The only solution is to train the will and get closer to the stoic.

**Student** : Is there a method or a process that will help me?

**Teacher** : The first task is to identify the objects on which the will must be applied. They can be classified into two buckets - negative and positive. Negative objects are those actions that obstruct your progress. These need to be rejected. Positive objects are those things that will help your progress and need to be embraced. The best solution would be a simultaneous movement of rejecting the negative tendencies and substituting it with the positive aspect. 

A uniformly strong will is developed by using it as frequently and as decisively as possible. Its usage must become an extremely interesting occupation and no opportunity for its usage must be missed. The greatest advantage of using the will is that it prevents the consciousness from falling down. As long as the contact with the ideal is there, the usage of the will becomes easier. The greatest utility of the will is that it maintains the level of consciousness, so that when the individual is subjected to the most severe tests, he can call for help more easily. And it must be absolutely clear that without a strong will no action is possible, leave alone a concentrated action.

But a one-time application will take you nowhere. A consistent use of this method steadily strengthens the will. This seems obvious, but one look at the growing pile of broken new-year resolutions is enough to convince you about its importance. Self-control and complacence live in orthogonal planes. A casual indulgence after several years of self-control is the first crack that slowly develops into a fissure. Self-control demands an unfaltering will with vigilance as its watchword.


**Student** : In summary, the will can be trained like the muscles of the body. The first step is to identify positive and negative tendencies. The next step is to reject negative tendencies and replace them with the positive ones. This process must be faithfully repeated by being ever vigilant and keeping the enemy of complacence at bay.
