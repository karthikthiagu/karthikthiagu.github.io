**A gentle reminder**<br><br>

I am tired of receiving over-polite "gentle" reminders for meetings. Reminders should be rude by nature; it is a wake up call. How about a very gentle alarm that doesn't disturb you in the morning? A reminder pops up like any other notification on my smartphone, and immediately qualifies as an interruption, its gentleness notwithstanding. It is like saying, "I am going to *gently* stab you." That is so oxymoronic! A simple reminder will just have the word "reminder", or even better, it will just be a forward of the original mail.<br><br>

**Respected Sir**<br><br>

"Sir" indicates respect. The use of the word "respected" introduces a sense of artificiality in the greeting. Most often it is used out of fear of offending the revered receiver. Let our letters begin with simpler and more truthful salutations.<br><br>

**Yours sincerely** <br><br>

The only use of the end-of-mail cliché is to signal the end of the mail. A simple "END" or a horizontal line at the end of the mail would suffice. Instead we carry the dead tradition of letter-writers and end every mail with such useless phrases. What is more pathetic is that kids are forced to learn these end-phrases in boring English classes.<br><br>
