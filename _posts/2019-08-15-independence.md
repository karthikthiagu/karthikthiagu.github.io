Birthdays are special. They mark the end of yet another year of our brief stay on Earth and the beginning of a new year. It is an ideal time to take a break from our busy lives, find a quiet place, look where we are headed, and with a peaceful mind plan for the next year. For most of us, though, it has devolved into a long and tiring day of celebrations. We are connected with everyone but ourselves. A great part of the day is usually spent in receiving and responding to greetings, a majority of them being mechanical wishes from Facebook friends prompted by some lifeless algorithm.  <br><br>

What is true of the individual is true of the nation. August $15^{th}$ is the birthday of that human collective we call India. Celebrations are in order. The Indian flag will be hoisted all across the nation, in schools, colleges and apartments; the national anthem will be passionately sung by millions. In some locations, patriotic citizens will reprimand their unpatriotic neighbors for not standing up when the anthem is being played. All of it will last for at most fifteen minutes. And then we all will head back to our living rooms to sit in front of televisions to watch advertisements, occasionally catching our favorite stars beat up villains. Let's be honest. The nation's birthday is primarily a holiday for most of us.<br><br>


So what is a better way of spending the $15^{th}$ of August? A popular suggestion is to briefly return to the past, recollect the sacrifices made by countless Indians to secure our independence and reflect on the greatness of our leaders such as the Mahathma and Pandit Nehru. While that is a noble thought, it has started becoming archaic. The current generation has very little connect with pre-independence India. Whatever little it knows about India's past generally doesn't extend beyond the chapters of high school history textbooks. A more reasonable suggestion is to turn our attention to this country's future. The aspirations and ideals of a nation, as much as that of the individuals that constitute it, always point in the direction of a better future. This is not to downplay the importance of our past, but to place greater emphasis on India's future. In the words of Sri Aurobindo, who shares his birthday with India:

> It [August $15^{th}$] marks for her the end of an old era, the beginning of a new age. But we can also make it by our life and acts as a free nation an important date in a new age opening for the whole world, for the political, social, cultural and spiritual future of humanity. 


Let August $15^{th}$ become an occasion for every citizen of this nation to ask what it means to be an Indian. A passive citizen is content with singing the national anthem and saluting the national flag. But these are merely outward markers. An active citizen engages with the idea of India, his place in this country, and the country's place in the world. He asks questions even if the answers are not readily available or cannot be easily furnished. What is my role in the country's growth? What has India given me and what have I given her in return? Where is she headed? What goals should she set for herself? It was one such question that ignited the struggle for independence: should we continue to let ourselves be governed by a foreign power or is self-rule better? Today the answer seems obvious. But the questions had to be asked at some point!
