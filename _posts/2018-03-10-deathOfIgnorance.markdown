title: Death of Ignorance
categories: Poems
excerpt: A poem that expresses a mother's feelings as her child makes the transition from innocent childhood to mature adulthood through a turbulent adolescence.

---



Little one, innocence incarnate,  
I envy your untainted self,  
Unbiased to things magical and mundane,  
With utter disregard for matters of fate,  
In the unshakable belief that life is just a game.

  <br><br>

As you enter fiery adolescence,  
No longer child, not yet man,  
Your shield of ignorance is cleaved asunder  
By the knowledge of this globe.

  <br><br>

Where can I turn my face,  
In search of innocenceâ€™s trace  
For she ruled this place,  
Until ignorance was commonplace.

  <br><br>

I wonder with a pang,  
If this ascent into knowledge,  
Leaving behind the shores of ignorance,  
Occurred a tad too soon.

  <br><br>

But the pain of mothering a dwarf,  
And the bane of interrupted growth,  
Remind me that the slumbering roots,  
Know not the joy of rising shoots.
