# The Future

**Student** : Sometimes I feel that the world is a depressing place.

**Teacher** : What is it that depresses you?

**Student** : Take the ever growing population for instance. Or the extremely competitive job market. A rotten education system. Where is all this heading? What is the point of whatever we do? 

**Teacher** : What can be cured must be cured at any cost. Your ignorance can be cured; take every effort to seek knowledge. Your laziness can be overcome; shake yourself, wake up and start working. Over-population, poverty, misery, human greed are all problems that we need to solve. But darkness cannot be dispelled by a darker darkness. And depression is the most debilitating darkness. It is only light that can remove darkness. Where do you find the light? First find it in yourself. How do you find it? By striving to be just the opposite of what you hate in the world. If you inhabit an imperfect world, strive to be perfect. If you find yourself in an ugly world, strive to express beauty in every one of your movements and actions. If you hate to live in the middle of a thousand distracting influences, rise above them by increasing your ability to concentrate.

**Student** : But how will this change the world?

**Teacher** : The very idea that you can change the world reeks of ambition. What do you know about the future? Do you know what the Divine has planned for the Earth? If you truly want to understand the divine plan, first understand yourself and the world around you. Understand what the world has been in the past, understand what it is in the present. And even after doing all this, you will not be in a position to predict the future. The Divine is working out his inscrutable harmonies standing behind a thick veil. The only saving gesture can be to rend this veil and surrender to the Lord by offering yourself as a perfect instrument. It is infinitely better to be the squirrel who helped build Srirama's bridge, than be the mighty Indrajit in Ravana's army.
