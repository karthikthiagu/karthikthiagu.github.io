**Book**: Make it Stick<br><br>
**Authors**: : Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, Mark A. McDaniel

<br><br>

This is not exactly a book review, it is more a set of notes about the book that tries to list salient points from some chapters. I have left out the last two chapters as they weren't relevant to me. There are other details in the book that I have left out, especially the parts that talk about the research done to validate the ideas that are expressed in this book.

## Chapter-1: Learning is Misunderstood

**Summary**: This chapter opens up with the author's claim that the prevailing strategies for learning such as rereading, highlighting and massed practice are not as efficient as we believe them to be. He reasons about the disadvantages of rereading as a learning strategy . He offers several alternatives such as retrieval, spaced practice, interleaving, concept maps and self-quizzing that he claims are better strategies for more durable learning. He draws on research in the field of cognitive science to substantiate his claims.<br><br>

**Key points**:<br><br>

- In most surveys rereading emerges as the most popular strategy among students.
- Rereading as a strategy has three failure modes:
	- It is time consuming.
	- It doesn't result in durable learning. In hindsight this seems to be true.
	- It creates an illusion of mastery. Rereading or greater exposure to a text makes us more familiar with the content. This familiarity is often mistaken for mastery. It is quite possible to become fluent with a text that we don't understand.
- Retrieval is essential for durable learning. 
- Testing is usually seen as a dipstick, a metric for measuring a student's understanding.
- Testing can also be seen as a learning tool
	- It exposes gaps in knowledge.
	- As it involves retrieval, the regions in the memory that store the content are strengthened when an effort is made to recall it. Retrieval interrupts forgetting.
		- The author claims that the more effortful the retrieval, stronger the connections become.


## Chapter-2 : To Learn, Retrieve

**Summary**: This chapter expands on the idea of retrieval as an important learning strategy. The author writes about experiments conducted by researchers to understand the effectiveness of retrieval for durable learning and discusses the findings.<br><br> 

**Key points**:<br><br>

- Repeated, spaced, effortful retrieval forms the bedrock of durable learning and results in reflex skills.
- A nice analogy: 
	- Retrieval is the knot that secures the beads of concepts in the memory-necklace. 
	- Forgetting is the unconscious loss of beads from the memory-necklace.
	- If you want something substantial in the first place, better practice retrieval. 
- There is a false dichotomy between basic knowledge and creative thinking. Without basic knowledge, developing creative thinking is meaningless. Without developing creative thinking, man becomes mechanical. So there was no dichotomy in the first place, as basic knowledge is a prerequisite for creative thinking.
- Psychologists call the strategy of retrieval the testing effect. What effect does testing have on learning?

## Chapter-3 :  Mix Up Your Practice

**Summary**: This chapter is about the problems with massed practice and various strategies to replace it. The alternatives are: spacing, interleaving and variation. The author offers anecdotal and empirical evidence to bolster his claim.<br><br>

**Key points:**<br><br>

- Massing is perceived to be more effective since the effects are immediately visible. Shooting free throws all day helps you become good at it temporarily, but spacing it will make it stick longer.
- Three ways to mix up practice
	- spacing: spreading out the practice over time so that it gives the brain sufficient time to consolidate what has been learnt
	- interleaving : mixing other activities instead of sequentially working on the same activity. The author shares the details of a research experiment where students learn to match paintings and their painters. The research demonstrates that students are much more accurate in the long term when they learn the association by interleaving the works of different painters. Surprisingly, this strategy provided diminished returns on immediate testing. One reason is that when paintings from different painters are interleaved, students are better able to study differences between painting styles and form a better mental representation of a painter's work. The author calls this "discrimination skills." It is not enough to learn to solve problems of a given type, it is also important to identify what type a given problem falls in.
	- variation : Even in a given activity, say football practice, introducing variations help in learning. For example, training to play free kicks from just one position repeatedly won't help, the position needs to be varied regularly. For what the player needs to learn is not to kick the ball from a particular position but to be able to score from any position.
- One downside of massed practice is that it may lead to sub-optimal knowledge structures. For example, in math textbooks, the problems at the end of every chapter unknowingly are doing harm to students. When solving problems from a section, the students already know what tool to use. While they might learn how to use the tool, they never learn when to use the tool. This can come only by interleaving and varying the problems.

## Chapter-4: Embrace difficulties

**Summary**: The author shares the idea of desirable difficulties, a term coined by professor of psychology Bjork. Desirable difficulties are attempts to make learning more effortful. The theory is that more effortful learning will strengthen connections in the brain and result in durable learning.<br><br>


**Key points**:  <br><br>

- More effortful the learning, more efficient the retrieval. When learning is more effortful, successful retrieval has a greater effect than when the learning is easy. This is because in the former situation, the learner tries to retrieve the fact or concept from his long-term memory, thus strengthening it. But in the latter, it is the short-term memory that is employed. Difficulties that induce effortful learning are called desirable difficulties.
- The next few sections deal with how the techniques of spacing, interleaving and variation mentioned in the previous chapters introduce desirable difficulties.
- Elaboration and reflection are two other strategies that make learning more effortful. In reflection, you look back at what you learnt, see what went wrong, and see how things could have been done better. As a writer, you are constantly elaborating, and seeking better ways of presenting the same information or conveying the same emotion.
- Generation is a term used to denote the effort spent to attempt a problem before looking up the solution. This kind of process makes the mind more plastic and creates the right sort of preconditioning to assimilate the solution better. Once we have attempted to solve the problem and failed, we will know where we went wrong when looking at the solution.
- Not all difficulties are desirable. Absence of a strong foundation in a subject is not a desirable difficulty. Fear and anxiety are other examples.
- The author also mentions the importance of viewing failures as stepping stones to success, as indicators of areas where the learner needs to improve by redoubling his efforts.

## Chapter-5: Avoid illusions of knowing


**Summary**: This chapter is about the ways in which we deceive ourselves into thinking that we are competent or skilled at something. <br><br>

**Key points:**:<br><br>

- As mentioned before, massing creates illusions of knowing. This is because familiarity with a text or a practice routine is mistaken for mastery. Massing may seem easy, but doesn't result in enduring learning. Spacing on the other hand may seem more effortful and not result in immediate improvement, but its long-term benefits offset these problems.
- He talks about Daniel Kahnenman's Thinking fast and thinking slow, the two type's of thinking, one subconscious and spontaneous, the other conscious and delayed. Ability to spot the mode of thinking may help us avoid bad decisions.
- He also talks about the Dunning-Kruger effect and mentions the paper "Unskilled and Unaware of it" that introduced this idea. The effect characterizes incompetent individuals who have a skewed perceptions about their competence. The authors of the original papers mention three possible explanations:
	- lack of constructive feedback for fear of hurting others
	- even in the presence of feedback, its accuracy is questionable. There are several ways to be wrong, but only one way to be right.
	- an inability to judge the competence of others may result in a skewed comparative self-assessment.
- He suggests periodic self-quizzing and testing as ways to avoid illusions of knowing. Looking for constructive feedback, being part of a professional group could help.

## Chapter-6: Get Beyond Learning Styles

**Summary**: The author's main points in this chapter is that different styles of learning, though popular in the mainstream, have little in the way of empirical research to support them. <br><br>

**Key points:**<br><br>

- The author talks about the popular VARK framework
	- visual
	- auditory
	- reading
	- kinesthetic
- He believes that learning style is not that important a factor when it comes to designing learning strategies.
- He mentions two theories of intelligence.
	- Howard Gardner: Gardner mentions eight different learning styles
		- logical-mathematical
		- verbal
		- musical
		- spatial
		- kinesthetic
		- inter-personal
		- intra-personal
		- naturalistic
	- The other is Sternberg's theory of successful intelligence. He proposes three types
		- analytical - the type that is required to do well in standardized tests like JEE or SAT
		- creative - this type of intelligence is required when confronting novel situations that need a synthesis of concepts in new ways to solve the problem
		- practical - this is about adapting to everyday life, doing the things that life demands of us on  a day to day basis
