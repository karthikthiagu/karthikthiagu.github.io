Dear speakers, writers and readers of the English language,<br><br>

Words have a life of their own. They have a specific form and function. We must not treat words like the wave-particles of quantum mechanics; a dual nature with a diffused representation that can hold simultaneously a multitude of meanings and can be forced into one such state when used in a specific context. This is precisely the way we treat certain words like awesome and epic. Words, at the same time, should not be circumscribed by too narrow a context that strip them of their generality. If the word exquisite can only describe Persian gems and not Beethoven’s fifth symphony or Shankara’s Advaita, we are doing it a disservice. But do not embarrass it by demanding that it accompany sandwiches. Exquisite sandwiches sounds jarring to say the least.<br><br>

This is not just about the usage of words but also about our preoccupation with certain oft repeated expressions that are in vogue. Two such words to which we unfailingly return are awesome and epic. Urbandictionary.com captures this perfectly: awesome is a word Americans use to describe everything (and Indians very enthusiastically embrace all things American without the slightest questioning). Another quirk I have observed during conversations is the tendency to prepend phrases totally void of meaning prior to statements. It goes like this: “There is this really awesome video of a cat climbing the stairs.” Or something like this: “I was watching this movie the other day and it was insanely brilliant. It was just epic.” I wonder what Homer and Vyasa would have to say about the stuff our epic moments are made of! The colloquial use of awesome and epic have relegated their formal counterparts to such low standards that we are in need of some good replacements. The need to frequent these words exists for two reasons. One is conformity with the world and its standards. The constant pressure to tow the line, the need to belong to a peer group. The second is for want of better words. One can’t rummage through the pages of a dictionary to find a suitable description for the pizza one is eating. Somehow the word delicious escapes one’s memory or one deliberately avoids it, much like an unwelcome visitor on a Sunday night. Awesome is a panacea for all our vocabulary-woes. We cling on to a few words in our already insipid and inadequate repertoires, like a baby monkey that latches itself firmly onto its mother’s belly for dear life.<br><br>

What could have been the origin of the word awesome in its current form? I can only surmise: some dude in California blurts out that the sandwich he had for breakfast was awesome. His girlfriend finds that “really-really cool”. She starts using the word quite frequently. When people find that awesomeness is the in-thing, they realize that if sandwiches can be awesome, everything under the sun qualifies to be awesome. That was the idealist in me, haranguing about the ills of the English language and the whims of its users that changed the course of some truly awesome words. Now for some dose of realism.<br><br>

Is it as bad as it sounds? Who is the arbiter that pronounces judgements on the meaning of words? Who are the sentries that guard the pages of our dictionaries from emendation? The meaning of a word is not immutable. Nice used to mean “silly, foolish and simple”. Silly referred to things worthy or blessed. Naughty meant naught or nothing. Anne Curzan, a professor of English does an awesome job of putting things in perspective in her enlightening TED talk. She raises several noteworthy points and I will elaborate on a few here.<br><br>

A striking observation she makes at the beginning concerns our perception of dictionaries. We treat the dictionary and the definitions therein as the final word and in this respect it stands on a par with religious scriptures. But unlike the scriptures which carry cryptic ideas garbed in immortal words uttered by ancient seers, dictionaries and the meanings invested in words are human creations of a much more ephemeral nature. The walls of the dictionary are not impenetrable. The old and the archaic are banished from its kingdom, just as the new and trendy are welcomed, albeit reluctantly, while those in need of a makeover are tweaked to suit youthful tongues. The only pertinent variable that editors concern themselves with is usage. After all, the supreme utility of language is to help us communicate and understand one another. If using awesome helps you feel much more at home than some other adjective, so be it. It is a personal choice and one must not opine on the way people use words. I understand that I am treading on sensitive ground. As professor Anne concludes in her talk, it is all a question of attitude. Do we want to be pedantic and wage language wars over the meaning of words in dictionaries, or do we want to sit back and appreciate the way the terrain of the language is shaping up?<br><br>

The speaker also introduced me to a useful tool that offers interesting insights on the evolution of words - Google Ngram Viewer. This utility tracks the usage of words by poring over printed sources over the last couple of centuries. Look at the ascendancy of awesome. Though not completely reliable, this graph is an acceptable indicator of the increasing usage of the word.<br><br>

Benjamin Franklin, in a letter addressed to the philosopher David Hume in the year 1760 writes that he had given up on the word colonize as it was not in common use in the Americas back then, all this when the European powers were busy colonizing the world. His statement was quite accurate as can be seen in this chart taken from the same ngram viewer.<br><br>

In a similar vein, the english professor also mentions words like defriend and unfriend that have not yet found a place in dictionaries, yet enjoy complete support from users. It is we, the users, who shape the language. A spoken word, when uttered through a sizable number of speakers for a sufficiently long period of time, naturally acquires the right of entry into dictionaries. For now, the formal meaning of awesome in the Oxford dictionary is “something that inspires awe”, the informal definition being “extremely good; excellent”. We will wait and watch as the more platitudinous definition, a Brutus so to speak, stabs the awe-inspiring mighty Caesar in the interest of Rome, speakers of this beautiful tongue.<br><br>
