Imagine a clean, white shirt. The moment a small stain appears on the shirt, even if it is only in a corner that is not immediately visible to human eyes, the purity of the shirt is lost - it is no longer a white shirt. But small stains are not bad. With some effort they can be removed, and the shirt can be restored to its former glory, thanks to Ujala and Tide. But as we let the shirt wallow more and more in sludge, the stains start becoming prominent, so much so that the very nature or character of the shirt changes. It is no longer the white, pure shirt. It acquires a brownish color, and starts smelling horribly. What is even more depressing is that these newly acquired stains will not wear off easily, promises by detergent companies notwithstanding. An immense effort of repeated cleansing is required to recover the original purity. The cleansing required is in proportion to the extent of the damage. But even if that is possible, a more efficient solution to ensure the continued purity of the shirt, is “constant vigilance”. One must not let the shirt come anywhere near the sludge in the future. Any further indulgence will begin the whole process anew. With every cycle of indulgence-stain accrual-cleansing, the confidence in one’s ability to successfully cleanse the stained shirt will weaken. For the mind would have by now sensed the impending indulgence, and would start wondering if there is any sense in the cleansing process. Let the shirt remain brown, who cares?<br><br>

The first lesson we learn is that problems must be spotted quickly and removed in the bud. These problems may belong to any domain, but are especially relevant to relationships. Bad contacts are like stains on the character. They affect one part of the being, and slowly start spreading. It is best if we can spot them early and expunge them from our systems. Stains arising from bad contacts can lead to total discoloration. The second lesson that may not be immediately apparent is that we must always be aware of the impermanence of all contacts. If the soul’s journey to God can be scaled down to a day, a single birth is one minute. In this minute of existence that we call life, we spend close to 50 seconds with the people closest to us, our family. As for other relationships, they come and go, none lasting for more than one second. How foolish it is to waste our energies on these one second phenomena, transient and perishable! The dash of color that we see during the early stages of a relationship will not appear like stains. It is only with increasing familiarity that we become aware of their true nature. When familiarity increases, it always leads to friction, because familiarity has contact as its basis, and contact engenders friction. The test of a good relationship is when both the parties involved function as independent entities, neither affecting or binding the other, especially during periods of separation. The great Kahlil Gibran writes about marriages, but it holds true for all relationships in life:

> You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.<br>
You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days.<br>
Ay, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.<br>
But let there be spaces in your togetherness,<br>
And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.<br><br>
Love one another, but make not a bond of love:<br>
Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.<br>
Fill each other’s cup but drink not from one cup.<br>
Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf<br>
Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,<br>
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. <br><br>
Give your hearts, but not into each other’s keeping.<br>
For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.<br>
And stand together yet not too near together:<br>
For the pillars of the temple stand apart,<br>
And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other’s shadow.


The third and final lesson is to not neglect relationships altogether. If we are weak enough to let stains appear on the shirt we wear, the problem rests squarely on us. We have not learnt to be together without binding one another. The solution is not to run away from all contacts. We must instead strengthen our stain-repelling filters, and understand the need for restraint in our relationships. These are incredibly difficult, but not impossible. It is never advisable to get lost in a relationship. Unwanted contacts move us away from our true natures. This discord and disharmony will very soon lead to ruin. “Constant vigilance” is sole route of escape.
