# Manufacturing Discovery


**Student** : I feel that something is not right with graduate education. A steady stream of papers keep coming out of every institute. What is the point of these many papers?

**Teacher** : Is your problem with the discoveries themselves?

**Student** : No. It is with the way that they are being made. It seems artificial.

**Teacher** : We have started manufacturing discovery. Universities and research labs are the factories where students are employed to manufacture discoveries. Every year scores of students push products on the assembly line and move to some other factories to manufacture more discoveries. Professors are skilled marketers who work with students to package and advertise the discovered objects in documents called research papers. The value of a research paper is its citation count. Research papers together with their citation counts form the currency of the academic world. Each field has several research-expos, called conferences, a mega-advertising event for advertisers and factory workers.

**Student** : Was it so bad in the past?

**Teacher** : I don't think so. And even today, what is bad is the mechanization of discovery, not discovery itself. There are plenty of scientists and thinkers who are discoverers in the true sense, not yet corrupted by the system. The world continues to produce intellectually honest scientists.

**Student** : I don't think this disease is limited to academia.

**Teacher** : Indeed, the problem is with the age we live in. Take music for example. The film industry requires songs for mass consumption. Composers manufacture songs, musicians lend their voices to package and advertise them. YouTube is the market for selling these products, with the number of views deciding the value of the product.

**Student** : What is the way out of this mess?

**Teacher** : Reverse engineering discoveries may help students earn a PhD or help a professor get tenure, but it will not produce original minds. Let us train our students to love learning and problem solving. Discoveries will then become emergent phenomena. As Sri Aurobindo says, "it is by allowing Nature to work that we get the benefit of the gifts she has bestowed on us."

**Student** : In summary, we need to encourage students to constantly keep learning and solving problems, not with an eye on the results, but simply because the whole process is so enjoyable.
