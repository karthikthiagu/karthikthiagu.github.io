excerpt: Learning is like climbing a ladder, leaving ignorance behind and moving towards light.

At the lowest rung of the knowledge ladder is the ignorant infant, “mewing and puking in nurse’s arms.” To him, the world is a vast, inexplicable arena, holding innumerable secrets in its bosom. At each corner, some hidden mystery is unveiled. The toddler measures the land with his tiny feet, scans the skies with his shining eyes, feels the world around him with his soft hands. Everything seems big and imposing. A few years later, he has grown, but the huge world still overwhelms him. Can you show me something smaller than me, he asks, I am bored of looking at big things.<br><br>

The next ten years of his existence is spent within the confines of a building that has been erected with the ostensible purpose of enlightening young minds, by stuffing equations, historical facts, and the periodic table into little craniums. The first twenty years of life are, in one way or the other, inextricably linked with the school. When I come to think of it now, it is ridiculous that one has to spend this long a duration in school, more than one fourth of a lifetime. Is that necessary? What exactly happens in this twenty year period? The claim is that we acquire knowledge. This is a loaded claim, and therefore needs careful scrutiny. Schools use the examination as a means to create the illusion of acquiring knowledge. Passing an examination satisfactorily gives students a false sense of competence, a feeling of having arrived somewhere, of having accomplished something, of having become more knowledgeable. A headlong fall into complacency is the most pernicious consequence of examinations. Contrast this with Newton’s wise words:

> I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

Or Socrates’ fine saying :

> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.

We can never truly know everything about everything in the world, nor know can we even know everything about something in the world . Knowledge about a thing is not a finite whole that can be completely grasped in a finite number of attempts. Instead it is an infinite ladder that one progressively climbs as one becomes less ignorant. Acquisition of knowledge must then be seen as a continuous march from a great ignorance to lesser ignorance, a relentless climb from partial truth to a more complete truth: असतो मा सद्गमय. It is an uncovering of the veil of darkness that is ignorance: तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय. When one takes such an attitude towards learning, the process of acquiring knowledge, or the means, gains greater predominance over the ends. For there is no perceivable end in sight. We never stop learning. We never become masters; there is still scope for improvement.<br><br>

A few days back, one of my old relatives approached me to help her prepare for a quiz contest. She listed down all the keywords that she had googled : great personalities of India, great scientists, important dates, current affairs, and so on. She was asking me if this was sufficient, and whether she had missed out something. I merely replied that it was more than enough, and she left a few minutes later, wearing a victorious expression on her face. That moment stung me very sharply. I thought about the fallibility of human knowledge; how utterly ignorant we are! It still amazes me when people go around claiming that they have strong IQs, or are very good at general knowledge. This is the Dunning-Kruger effect in full display - “relatively unskilled persons suffer illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than it really is.” Alexander Pope writes in his poem “An Essay on Criticism”:

> A little learning is a dangerous thing; <br>
drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring: <br>
there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, <br>
and drinking largely sobers us again.

Closely connected with the above sentiment is Feynman’s remarks on the difference between knowing the name of something, versus understanding what that truly is:

> The next Monday, when the fathers were all back at work, we kids were playing in a field. One kid says to me, “See that bird? What kind of bird is that?” I said, “I haven’t the slightest idea what kind of a bird it is.” He says, “It’s a brown-throated thrush. Your father doesn’t teach you anything!” But it was the opposite. He had already taught me: “See that bird?” he says. “It’s a Spencer’s warbler.” (I knew he didn’t know the real name.) “Well, in Italian, it’s a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it’s a Bom da Peida. In Chinese, it’s a Chung-long-tah, and in Japanese, it’s a Katano Tekeda. You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird. So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing—that’s what counts.” (I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.)

The picture that I have painted looks bleak. If the pursuit of knowledge is a thing so difficult, are our efforts to acquire it justified? The answer is obviously in the affirmative. What puts me off is our wrong estimate of ourselves and the world around us, and also the wrong attitude that we have towards learning and knowledge. A more modest understanding of our abilities is the need of the hour. There must be a greater stress on our perpetual state ignorance, not expressed in a discouraging way, but with the nobler intention of making us more humble, more curious about the world around us. When we realize that we don’t know much, it will spur us towards greater action.
